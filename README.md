> Match job descriptions to resumes using AI! A smart, NLP-powered tool for job seekers, HR, and recruiters.

## 🔍 Overview

This tool uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Cosine Similarity** to intelligently compare a **resume** with a **job description**, returning a match score and feedback.

It was built using:
- 🐍 Python
- 📊 Scikit-learn
- 🧼 NLTK for text cleaning
- 🌐 Streamlit for UI

---



## 🚀 Features

✅ Match Score between Resume & Job Description  
✅ Clean, Tokenize, and Vectorize text using TF-IDF  
✅ Cosine Similarity for accurate match  
✅ Intuitive UI built with Streamlit  
✅ Feedback based on the score (e.g., “Excellent match!”)  
✅ Instantaneous results — AI in real time!
